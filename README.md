- How to use GitHub for collaboration (using branches and dealing with merge conflicts)
- Using flexbox, grid and media queries for a responsive design
- Using external npm packages in our projects (Canvas-confetti and FontAwesome)
- Incorporating promises/await/setTimeout to simulate a CPU turn

## Future improvements
- Write tests for JS feature 
- Incorporate online play using websockets
